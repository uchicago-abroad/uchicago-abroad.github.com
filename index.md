## A Need for Transparency

Transparency is important for students. Course evaluations are published online, yet the Study Abroad office does not provide a way for students to see past evaluations. 

With this in mind, a number of students who studied abroad during the Winter of 2012 decided to create this website. 

## What We've Created

This site will serve as a central repository where students can share their study abroad evaluations. It will be an open forum for reviews, in order to provide other students with a better understanding of study abroad options.

## Submit an Evaluation

Shouldn't this information have been public prior to registration for the study abroad program? We certainly think so. If you agree and are interested in sharing your experience, [please submit](/submit) your evaluation here.

## Help us Grow

Do you know any others who studied abroad? Send them an email!
